Hello person who uses chromeos and wants to completely destroy their chrome browser. This script is something I made for a school thing but thought I might put here. 
Before you start taking the steps, make sure to look at the License and that you agree to the terms before using this. (It's an MIT, but additional lines are at the bottom).
By using my code, you agree to adhere to the license.

Before you start, copy the code in Main and put it in a text editor.
First, your going to need your user token, as I call it. Getting it is easy: Download a text file and open it. (You can make one at editpad.org and download it)
Second, open the file and have a look at the URL for it. It should look something like this (if it's in your downloads folder): 
file:///home/chronos/THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT/MyFiles/Downloads/text.txt
Right after chronos, copy that long string of letters and numbers (should start with u-)
Then take that ID and put it in where it says "REPLACE ME WITH YOUR USER TOKEN" (without the quotes, should be on line 16)
After that, your all set. Just make sure your running it from your downloads file. If you have any problems, make sure to check that you completed all the instructions correcly.
